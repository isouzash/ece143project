The notebook should be run as "Run all" at once.
The notebook presents the code for data manipulation and how the the plots were generated.

We used requests to upload the zip file in kaggle website. We used zipfile and pandas to load the csv file.
We used pandas for data visualization and to filter the data. We used numpy and pandas to insert a new column in our dataset (EPA classification). We used pandas and matplotlib to generate the plots.

Plots:
- Bar plot data count for the whole United States, 50 states
- Bar plot with top 10 states with highest AQI from 2011 to 2015
- Pie charts comparing EPA categories in California and USA
- EPA categories of air quality measurements per year
- Stack bar of EPA categories per year in California
- Stack bar of EPA categories per year in top polluted cities in California
- Stack bar of EPA categories per year in San Diego
- Stack bar of EPA categories per year in Los Angeles
